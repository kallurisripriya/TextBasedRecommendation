1. Purpose of the Project:
     The proposed system aims for generating top 5 related articles for each article taken in a given dataset. This system uses the subject and
     body of the article as the data to generate the recommendations using NLP and Machine learning algorithms. This system is called as 
     the Text Based Recommendation system.  

2. Software files:
     In this project we need NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, MySQL, Apache Tomcat and NetBeans. We need to install NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn in your system before 
     starting up with the project if using a python shell, else we can use the Google Collaboratory directly through the browser without any installation.
     NetBeans, Apache Tomcat and mysql needed to be installed for accessing the webpages through localhost.

3. Project files:
	•	Recommendations.ipynb
	•	CreatePostServlet.java
	•	MemberRegistrationServlet.java
	•	MemberLoginServlet.java
	•	JdbcConnection.java
	•	dataset.csv

5. Project Execution Steps:
    Step 1 : Open Recommendations.ipynb in google colaboratory and attach dataset.csv to it.
    Step 2 : Run all the code which generates recommendations into csv file.
    Step 3 : Use this csv file in your database to show recommendations on your webpage. 
    Step 4 : Load the csv file into the Database. 
    Step 5 : Now open the NetBeans and Run the Project.
    Step 6 : A login page will be opened. If the user is existing user then they can login. If the user is the new user then they should Register first.
    Step 7 : After Registering the user can login.After login the user can view the Subjects of all the posts. They can click on any of the subject of post.
    Step 8 : Now the post will be displayed and the Recommendations for that post will be displayed.
