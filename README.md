1. Purpose of the Project:
     The proposed system aims for generating top 5 related articles for each article taken in a given dataset. This system uses the subject and
     body of the article as the data to generate the recommendations using NLP and Machine learning algorithms. This system is called as 
     the Text Based Recommendation system.  

2. Software files:
     In this project we need NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, MySQL, Apache Tomcat and NetBeans. We need to install NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn in your system before 
     starting up with the project if using a python shell, else we can use the Google Collaboratory directly through the browser without any installation.
     NetBeans, Apache Tomcat and mysql needed to be installed for accessing the webpages through localhost.

3. Project files:
	•	Recommendations.ipynb
	•	CreatePostServlet.java
	•	MemberRegistrationServlet.java
	•	MemberLoginServlet.java
	•	JdbcConnection.java
	•	dataset.csv

5. Project Execution Steps:
    Step 1 : Open Recommendations.ipynb in google colaboratory and attach dataset.csv to it.
    Step 2 : Run all the code which generates recommendations into csv file.
    Step 3 : Use this csv file in your database to show recommendations on your webpage. 
    Step 4 : select proj.py file--> Right click on proj.py file --> select open with --> 
             click Python.
    Step 5 : Python terminal will be opened and a url will be displayed
    Step 6 : Copy and paste that url in your browser and press enter the webpage 
             will be opened.
    Step 7 :  Enter the 14 nutrient values in the webpage and click on predict 
              button.
    Step 8 : The result will be displayed in the webpage.
